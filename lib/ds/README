campaign-start-config.json
---------------------------
This file defines how responses to the campaign start multiple choice prompt
should be handled. The key for every object is the opt-in path for the
campaign start prompt. KNOW, PLAN, and DO fields are the mData IDs for those
respective sets of tips. PROVE, on the other hand, is the opt in path ID for
the start of the report back flow.

'campaign start opt in path': {
  '__comments': 'This is ignored.',
  'KNOW': KNOW mData ID,
  'PLAN': PLAN mData ID,
  'DO': DO mData ID,
  'PROVE': opt in path ID for the start of the report back
}
